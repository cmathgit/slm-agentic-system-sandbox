# slm-agentic-system-sandbox
Agentic SLM Sandbox is a small-model-first testbed for building and evaluating agentic systems. It includes minimal controllers for LM-first and controller-first orchestration, tool-calling scaffolds, a secure logger to collect agent traces, and a repeatable LLM→SLM migration workflow (task clustering, model selection, PEFT fine-tuning, routing, and iterative evals). Inspired by [“Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI”](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/) and its LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
